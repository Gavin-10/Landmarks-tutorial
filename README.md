# Welcome To Landmarks

This is my repository of the Apple SwiftUI Landmarks tutorial.
This project not only includes the tutorial material, but also includes
bug fixes and UI improvements. The badge is more uniform and doesn't step
outside the geometry reader boundaries, previously causing the ends to be
chopped off, the list view now clipps the images with a circle for a
more uniform look, and the profile edit view now appears on a seperate
sheet, making navigation more uniform.
